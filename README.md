# To-Do List Application

A modern, interactive To-Do List application with full CRUD functionality, progress tracking, and celebratory UI feedback.

📌 Overview

This To-Do List App is a frontend-focused project designed to demonstrate clean UI design, user interaction handling, and state-based logic using core web technologies.
It helps users efficiently manage tasks while providing visual feedback through a progress bar and confetti animation upon task completion.

🚀 Features

➕ Add Tasks – Create new to-do items easily

✏️ Edit Tasks – Modify existing tasks without re-adding

❌ Delete Tasks – Remove individual tasks

✅ Mark as Complete – Track completed tasks

📊 Progress Bar – Visual indicator of task completion progress

🎉 Confetti Effect – Triggered when all tasks are completed

💾 Persistent State – Maintains task state during session

🎨 Modern UI – Clean layout with smooth interactions

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Semantic structure

CSS3 – Styling, animations, layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic, DOM manipulation, state handling

No external frameworks were used to keep the project lightweight and performance-optimized.

🔐 Logic & UX Considerations

Confetti effect is strictly triggered only when all tasks are completed, not on deletion

Progress bar dynamically recalculates based on task state

Edit and delete actions do not interfere with completion logic

UI feedback ensures users always understand the current state
